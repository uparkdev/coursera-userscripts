# Coursera video player UX improvements

__TL;DR__: Extensions for [coursera.org](http://coursera.org) to improve UX of html video player - play/pause video on mouse click and space bar, and auto-play next video.

#### Additional information

This script on [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org) - [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/172307](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/172307)

The script is partially based on [Coursera EXT - Auto next video](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/126493) script by [FireBiker](http://userscripts.org/users/412073).

Using this script you'll be able to pause and play video by mouse clicking on the video instead of the small play/pause button, and by pressing space bar when the video is focused. Script also adds an option to enable auto-play of next available lecture in current screen mode - if you was watching the video in full-screen mode, the next video will open in full-screen mode too. To enable auto-play you just need to check the checkbox located in the 'Next' button (it's visible only in non full-screen mode). 

The script was tested only in FF so if you find any bug, don't blame me much, add a comment [on userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/172307) or on [github page of the script](https://github.com/zihotki/coursera-userscripts) with the detailed error description or, better, create a pull request on github.
